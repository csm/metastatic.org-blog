{:title "Downhill"
 :layout :post}

I have and generally like an Apple Watch,
but over time the timer app has gone
downhill in increasing ways, with no real 
explanation why:

* The "recents" list of times would only
track custom times, since preset times
were easily available just below, as, you
know, presets. Now it's any time you've 
entered. Presumably someone, maybe users,
maybe some bullshit Vice President, thought 
your history had to have every time you've 
entered. They are wrong, of course.
* The custom time entry now selects hours,
not minutes, when you open it. Presumably 
again because users and/or Mr Overpaid V.P.
thought selecting the middle dial, not the
leftmost one, was wrong. Again, they are 
wrong.

I'm eagerly awaiting the next update that
makes this simple app's UI even worse.
