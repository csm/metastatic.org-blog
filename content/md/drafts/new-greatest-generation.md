I don't really know if it was ethical or not to have
children, but we did, and thusfar they (9 months and 4
years) have been the most worderful part of my life.
Our climate is changing, and by all reckoning it's going
to get much harder for us humans to survive on the planet
without some kind of radical change in our behavior. It
may have been unethical, selfish, to have children at
this point in history, since they're going to bear the
brunt of the first phase of this disaster, with no clear
end coming anytime soon.
